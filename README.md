## üéØ How to Play

1. **Choose a Scenario**: Start with "The Discovery" scenario featuring a 100-meter asteroid
2. **Analyze the Threat**: Click "Simulate Impact" to see the potential damage
3. **Plan Your Deflection**: Adjust the delta-v (velocity change) and time before impact
4. **Execute the Mission**: Click "Deflect Asteroid" to attempt the deflection
5. **Save the World**: Successfully deflect the asteroid away from populated areas!

## üî¨ Physics Implementation

### Impact Calculations
- **Mass**: Calculated from diameter assuming spherical shape
- **Kinetic Energy**: E = ¬Ωmv¬≤
- **TNT Equivalent**: Conversion using 4.184 √ó 10‚Åπ J per ton TNT
- **Crater Diameter**: Pi-scaling formula based on Holsapple scaling laws
- **Earthquake Magnitude**: USGS empirical relation: log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(E) = 1.5M + 4.8

### Deflection Model
- **Linear Approximation**: Simplified along-track deflection calculation
- **Distance Shifted**: Œîd = Œîv √ó t (where t is time before impact)
- **Success Criteria**: Minimum 1000m deflection required
